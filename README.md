How to build Python Application using PyQT <img src="Images/PyQt.png"  width="100">

As developers, we spend our days with code. The site you're reading this on is mostly modules, packages, libraries, frameworks, and the like. But users see applications.

When building our own applications, open-source Python applications are a gold mine of practical patterns that we know work together. A production application is worth a thousand blog posts and Stack Overflow answers.

User Stories
=======
User stories are simple, yet extremely powerful constructs: they describe pieces of functionality from a user’s point of view, expressed in a solid, compact way. They reflect what a particular class of user needs and the value to be gained. The format is very simple and easy to use. There are several variations, including:

# code block
    “As a <role or persona>, I can <goal/need> so that <why>”

    Or, in another instance:
# code block
    “As a <particular class of user>, I want to <be able to perform/do something> so that <I get some form of value or benefit>”
